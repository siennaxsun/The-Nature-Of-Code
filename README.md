# Learning Algorithms from The Nature Of Code

This repository is to document my self-paced learning progress following **Daniel Shiffman’s “The Nature of Code”**.  
All sketches are implemented in **p5.js**, exploring algorithms that simulate natural systems — such as motion, forces, genetic algorithms, and fractals.
